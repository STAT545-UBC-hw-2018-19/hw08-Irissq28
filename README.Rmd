# STAT547 Homework 08 repo

## Overview

The task of this homework is to add more features to the BC Liquor Store Price shiny app, which is originally created by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/), the data is from [OpenDataBC](https://www.opendatabc.ca/dataset/bc-liquor-store-product-price-list-current-prices)

[Here](https://siqia.shinyapps.io/bcl-sa/) is **the link of this shiny app**, hosted by [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/).

The [bcl_data](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Irissq28/tree/master/bcl-data) folder contains the R script [app.R](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Irissq28/blob/master/bcl-data/app.R), raw data [bcl_data.csv](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Irissq28/blob/master/bcl-data/bcl-data.csv), [style.css](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Irissq28/blob/master/bcl-data/style.css) is to change the fonts style of this app. [rsconnect](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Irissq28/tree/master/bcl-data/rsconnect/shinyapps.io/siqia) is an automatically built folder when deploying the app. [www](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw08-Irissq28/tree/master/bcl-data/www) folder contains the image displayed in the app.

### Use the DT package

Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table BY replacING tableOutput() with DT::dataTableOutput() and renderTable() with DT::renderDataTable().
